          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>This extension displays your recent history, recently closed tabs, most visited pages and recent bookmarks in a one click popup menu.</p>
          <h2>Changelog</h2>
          <p>1.9.3 - Fixed a few bugs and cleaned up the code a little.</p>
          <p>1.9.2 - You can choose what icon you would like in the address bar for Recent History in the options page. Items which have been bookmarked will show a star next them in the history page. The middle-click function has been changed back so when you middle-click an item in the popup window the item opens in a new tab in the background and leaves the popup open.</p>
          <p>1.9.1 - Fixed a few bugs with the most visited list. The new history page is the default history manager but this can be changed in options. The new history page shows more search items from the past and not just from your recent history. A few things from the options page have been changed.</p>
          <p>1.9 - A brand new history page has been made which can be accessed by clicking on the "Show All History" link. Polish translation has been added, thanks to the person who commented. When you left click an item in the popup menu it opens in the current tab and if you middle click the item, it will open up in a new tab. When the popup or the history page is opened the search bar is focused so you search without clicking on the search field. The recently closed tabs history isn't deleted upon new browser session any more. When you hover over a recent history or most visited item you will be able to see the visit count for that URL. The most visited history items are now gathered from the past 4 weeks which should give you an accurate list of most visited URLs. You can also remove the URLs you do not want to show up in the most visited list in the options page. The popup should open up slightly quicker after you open it the first time. Lastly a few minor changes have been made here and there.</p>
          <p>1.8.2 - Fixed issue of the extension causing a high cpu load on some systems like Mac OS and Linux. Please make sure your using the latest stable version of Chrome.</p>
          <p>1.8.1 - Fixed issue of time being displayed even if the option is switched off.</p>
          <p>1.8 - Added new history API so the recent history you see is from chrome's actual history. This extension still needs to track your history for recently closed tabs however. I've added a recent bookmarks section also. Some options had to be removed due to either it not being allowed, better efficient coding and mainly due to the addition of chrome 5 APIs. Languages are still supported, however the only way you can use them is to install the locale version of chrome. This is the official way to support localization in chrome extensions. The history manager has been removed for now however I'm working on another new one which will act as your default history page.</p>
          <p>1.7.4 - Fixed issue of no favicons and titles showing up.</p>
          <p>1.7.3 - Added Portuguese translation (thanks to Maicon), the option to remove the time in the popup menu and increased limit for history items from 20 to 30.</p>
          <p>1.7.2 - Fixed issue of popup menu not showing up and recent history items being repeated. Added Arabic translation and corrected the Russian translation thanks to the guys who commented.</p>
          <p>1.7.1 - Fixed clear extension cache button on the popup menu.</p>
          <p>1.7 - Added most visited links, option to order the sections for the popup menu, option to remove the search box and a button on the menu to clear extension cache. You can now also input your own values in the options page. Fixed the search clear button being hidden by the scroll bar and fixed issue of repeated history items in the recently closed tabs section. Lastly the extension is now able to record your browsing history item before the page is fully loaded.</p>
          <p>1.6 - Added a search feature in the popup menu and you can now view a maximum of 100 history items in the history manager. Also fixed the issue of popup menu not showing up due to favicon url being in a restricted area (i.e. you have to be logged in).</p>
          <p>1.5.4 - Added "right click copy url" function when you right click on a history item in the popup menu. Increased maximum number of history items from 50 to 100. You can now show more recently closed tabs in the popup menu. Tips now show both title and url. Fixed "Recently closed tabs" section displaying wrong title/url.</p>
          <p>1.5.3 - Added Russian translation thanks to the person who commented.</p>
          <p>1.5.2 - Fixed issue of page going to the top after deleting history item and missing "Icon Size" translation text.</p>
          <p>1.5.1 - Fixed issue of not being able to delete history items with blank favicons.</p>
          <p>1.5 - Added a Recent History Manager which allows you to delete history items and search through them, buttons to the popup menu, Czech translation, option to change your icon and option to change width. Fixed utf-8 issue for some of the files.</p>
          <p>1.4.1 - Changed icon, thanks to the user who sent it to me and gave me the idea. Added German translation and updated the French translation, thanks to the guys who commented below.</p>
          <p>1.4 - Changed logo. Moved icon into the omnibar and you can choose what size icon you want to use. Added different language support and a blue background colour when hovering over a history item.</p>
          <p>1.3.3 - Added a new size icon, 19px x 19px (which is the size most extensions are using).</p>
          <p>1.3.2 - Fixed recently closed tabs cache for new users.</p>
          <p>1.3.1 - Fixed clear history on startup error.</p>
          <p>1.3 - Added option to clear history on startup. Fixed large favicons issue.</p>
          <p>1.2.4 - Fixed "Clear History" issue and added recent history title when recently closed tabs are disabled.</p>
          <p>1.2.3 - Fixed recently closed tabs cache from previous use of chrome.</p>
          <p>1.2.2 - Fixed recently closed tabs. It will reset every time you open up chrome.</p>
          <p>1.2.1 - Added 128px icon.</p>
          <p>1.2 - Fixed text padding on right hand side. Added "Recently Closed Tabs" section with the option to change the items number for it and disable it altogether. Fixed a few bugs and issues here and there.</p>
          <p>1.1 - No more duplicate history items.</p>
